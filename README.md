Shooting balls with a genuine witchblitz from a boat in a pool.

In a quiet hidden pool lives a small adventurous boat who spends its days gliding through shimmering water waves and drifting sound waves.
Whenever you left-click and move your mouse, the water begins to ripple and the air vibrates, forming waves the little boat loves to dance upon. If the chorus of sound becomes too loud, you can silence it with a soft tap on the S-key.

Curious glowing balls appear whenever you right-click on the water. They float gently, waiting to be nudged. A normal bump from the boat gives them a simple push—but when timing truly matters, the boat can release its rare Witchblitz spark by striking with the spacebar, sending the balls shooting forward with magical power. Choose your angle well, because a perfectly placed Witchblitz shot can turn the tide.

To explore the pool, you can steer the boat with the arrow keys, weaving between waves, balls, and echoes. And if you ever wish to see life from the boat’s own point of view, press C to slip into his perspective—press it again to return to the peaceful view above the pool.

You can zoom and rotate the world with your mouse, letting you watch every swirl, splash, and rolling crest of the waves as they spread across the water.

With waves to ride, mysteries to uncover, and magic to control, the little boat is ready for adventure.
All he’s waiting for… is you. Play alone or in competition with your friends.
